# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Railway Deployment Down

## Current Status
- ‚ùå Railway deployment is returning 404 errors
- ‚ùå Custom domain DNS not configured yet
- ‚úÖ All code fixes are complete and ready

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Fix (Do These Now)

### STEP 1: Fix Railway Deployment

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**:
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Log in and find your `itp-h5p-production` project

2. **Check Service Status**:
   - Look for your Node.js service
   - Check if it shows as "Failed" or "Stopped"
   - Click on the service to see details

3. **Review Deployment Logs**:
   - Click on the "Deployments" tab
   - Look at the latest deployment
   - Check build logs for any errors

4. **Trigger New Deployment**:
   - Click "Deploy" button to trigger a fresh deployment
   - Wait for build to complete (should take 2-3 minutes)

### STEP 2: Verify Environment Variables

In Railway, make sure these are set:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=${{ Postgres.DATABASE_URL }}
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here-minimum-32-chars
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here-minimum-32-chars
```

### STEP 3: Add PostgreSQL Database (if not done)

1. In Railway project dashboard
2. Click "Add Service"
3. Select "PostgreSQL"
4. Wait for it to deploy
5. The `DATABASE_URL` will be auto-generated

### STEP 4: Test Railway Deployment

Once deployment is successful:
- Visit your Railway URL (check dashboard for the correct URL)
- You should see the React frontend loading
- Test `/api/health` endpoint

### STEP 5: Configure Custom Domain

Only after Railway is working:

1. **In Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to your service settings
   - Add custom domain: `hoclieutuongtac2.com`
   - Railway will provide DNS instructions

2. **In Your Domain Registrar**:
   - Add the CNAME record as instructed by Railway
   - Wait for DNS propagation (1-24 hours)

## üîç Common Railway Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Application Error" or 404
- **Cause**: Build failed or service crashed
- **Fix**: Check logs, redeploy

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working
- **Cause**: Variables not properly set
- **Fix**: Re-add all required variables

### Issue: Database Connection Failed
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL not added or DATABASE_URL incorrect
- **Fix**: Add PostgreSQL service, use `${{ Postgres.DATABASE_URL }}`

## üìû Next Steps

1. Complete the Railway fixes above
2. Test the deployment thoroughly
3. Then proceed with custom domain setup
4. Report back with any error messages you see

## üÜò If You Need Help

Take screenshots of:
- Railway dashboard showing service status
- Any error messages in deployment logs
- Environment variables configuration

The code is ready - we just need to get Railway working properly!
