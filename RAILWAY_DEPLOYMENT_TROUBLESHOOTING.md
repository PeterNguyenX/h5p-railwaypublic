# Railway Deployment Error Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
**Error**: "There was an error deploying from source."
**Project**: h5p-hoclieutuongtac
**Source**: PeterNguyenX/h5p-railwaypublic

## 🔍 Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Docker Build Issues**
The most common cause is Docker build failing. Check these:

#### Solution A: Use Node.js Build Instead of Docker
- Go to Railway project settings
- Under "Build" section, change from "Docker" to "Node.js"
- Set build command: `npm run railway:build`
- Set start command: `npm run railway:start`

#### Solution B: Fix Dockerfile Issues
If using Docker, ensure these files exist:
- `✅ Dockerfile` (present)
- `✅ frontend/build/` directory (present)
- `✅ backend/package.json` (present)

### 2. **Package.json Issues**
Verify the main package.json has correct scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cd backend && node server.js",
    "build": "cd frontend && npm run build",
    "railway:build": "npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../backend && npm install",
    "railway:start": "cd backend && node server.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Repository Connection Issues**
- Ensure Railway project is connected to `PeterNguyenX/h5p-railwaypublic`
- Check if the repository is public and accessible
- Verify the branch is set to `main`

### 4. **Environment Variables**
Add these before deployment:
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=eac85e32b9406688819cf49913d730d90393c6efc061d023ae1e02d7e5b14e6f
SESSION_SECRET=5d13789498b4b3939fd3af5e4510afb5e55fe24f95303b26cb671e9b25a66fc8
```

### 5. **Build Configuration**
Try these Railway settings:
- **Build Command**: `npm run railway:build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run railway:start`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Root Directory**: `/` (entire repository)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix

### Option 1: Switch to Node.js Build (Recommended)
1. Go to Railway project settings
2. Under "Build" tab, select "Node.js" instead of "Docker"
3. Set:
   - Build Command: `npm run railway:build`
   - Start Command: `npm run railway:start`
4. Add environment variables
5. Trigger redeploy

### Option 2: Fix Docker Build
1. Check if Dockerfile is being used
2. Ensure frontend is pre-built (run `npm run build` in frontend folder)
3. Commit any changes
4. Push to repository
5. Trigger redeploy

### Option 3: Create New Deployment
1. Delete current deployment in Railway
2. Create new deployment with these settings:
   - Build: Node.js
   - Install: `npm install`
   - Build: `npm run railway:build`
   - Start: `npm run railway:start`

## 📋 Debugging Steps

1. **Check Railway Build Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - View "Deploy" logs to see exact error

2. **Verify Repository**
   - Ensure latest code is pushed
   - Check that `frontend/build/` exists
   - Verify all package.json files are valid

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Test the build commands locally
   npm run railway:build
   npm run railway:start
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Working Configuration

Once fixed, your Railway project should:
- Build successfully using Node.js
- Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
- Build the React frontend
- Start the backend server
- Be accessible at: `https://h5p-hoclieutuongtac-production.up.railway.app`

## 🆘 If Still Failing

If deployment continues to fail:
1. Check Railway build logs for specific error messages
2. Try deploying to a different platform (Render, Heroku) to isolate the issue
3. Consider using Railway's "Deploy from GitHub" with automatic build detection

The most likely fix is switching from Docker to Node.js build in Railway settings.
