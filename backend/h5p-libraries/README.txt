Place all official H5P library, editor, and player JS/CSS files here.

You can download the required files from https://h5p.org/node/944187 and https://h5p.org/documentation/for-developers/setting-up-the-h5p-editor

Example files to include:
- H5P/h5p.js
- H5P/h5p.css
- H5PEditor/editor.js
- H5PEditor/editor.css
- All content type libraries (as .js, .css, .json, etc.)

After placing the files, your frontend can load them from /h5p/libraries/ via the backend route.
