# Railway Project Setup: h5p-hoclieutuongtac

## 🎯 Your New Railway Project
**Project Name**: h5p-hoclieutuongtac
**Expected URL**: https://h5p-hoclieutuongtac-production.up.railway.app

## 📋 Setup Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository to the Railway project
- [ ] Select the `main` branch
- [ ] Set root directory to `/` (if entire repo is the project)

### ✅ Step 2: Configure Build Settings
Railway should auto-detect these, but verify:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` or from package.json
- **Start Command**: `npm start` or from package.json
- **Port**: Railway will set `PORT` environment variable automatically

### ✅ Step 3: Add Environment Variables
Copy and paste these into Railway dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=eac85e32b9406688819cf49913d730d90393c6efc061d023ae1e02d7e5b14e6f
SESSION_SECRET=5d13789498b4b3939fd3af5e4510afb5e4510afb5e55fe24f95303b26cb671e9b25a66fc8
```

### ✅ Step 4: Add Database
- Click "Add Service" → "PostgreSQL"
- This creates `DATABASE_URL` automatically
- Wait for database to be ready

### ✅ Step 5: Deploy
- Railway should automatically deploy once configured
- Check logs for any errors
- Wait for deployment to complete

### ✅ Step 6: Test Deployment
Once deployed, test these URLs:
- Health check: `https://h5p-hoclieutuongtac-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
- Main app: `https://h5p-hoclieutuongtac-production.up.railway.app/`

## 🔧 If Deployment Fails
Common issues and solutions:
1. **Build fails**: Check if all dependencies are in package.json
2. **Port issues**: Railway sets PORT automatically, your app should use `process.env.PORT`
3. **Database connection**: Wait for PostgreSQL service to be fully ready
4. **Environment variables**: Double-check all variables are set

## 📝 Current Status
- [x] Project created with name "h5p-hoclieutuongtac"
- [ ] GitHub repository connected
- [ ] Environment variables added
- [ ] PostgreSQL database added
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] App accessible at new URL

## 🎉 Expected Result
Once setup is complete, your H5P Interactive Learning Materials platform will be available at:
**https://h5p-hoclieutuongtac-production.up.railway.app**

This new URL perfectly reflects what your app actually does - it's an interactive learning materials platform, not a "minimal" app!
