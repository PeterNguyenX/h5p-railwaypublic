## Troubleshooting "Repository is Empty"

If Railway says the repository is empty:

1. **Double-check repository selection** in Railway dashboard
2. **Verify branch selection** (should be `main`)
3. **Check repository permissions** (public repo should work)
4. **Try reconnecting** the GitHub integration
