# H5P Rewatch and Auto-Popup Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the H5P rewatch functionality and ensure proper auto-popup behavior after rewatch.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rewatch Button Not Closing Question Window
**Problem**: When users clicked "Rewatch (5s before)", the question dialog remained open, preventing them from watching the video.

**Root Cause**: The dialog closing logic was not properly clearing all states immediately.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `handleRewatch` function to immediately close all feedback states and dialog
- Added proper state clearing sequence with `setH5pDialogOpen(false)` and `setSelectedH5PContent(null)`
- Improved video playback logic with better async handling and fallback mechanisms

### 2. H5P Content Showing as Button Instead of Auto-Opening After Rewatch
**Problem**: After rewatch, H5P content would show as a clickable button overlay instead of automatically opening the dialog.

**Root Cause**: The auto-popup logic was comparing against `autoShowContent` state, preventing the same content from showing again.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced auto-popup logic to properly handle rewatch scenarios
- Modified the condition to check `activeContent !== autoShowContent || !h5pDialogOpen`
- Added proper state clearing when no active content is present
- Improved dialog close handlers to properly reset states

## Code Changes

### Enhanced Rewatch Function
```typescript
const handleRewatch = async () => {
  console.log('Rewatch button clicked - closing dialog and rewinding video');
  
  // Store content reference before clearing states
  const contentToRewatch = currentContentForRetry;
  
  // Immediately close all feedback states and dialog
  setShowIncorrectFeedback(false);
  setCurrentContentForRetry(null);
  setH5pDialogOpen(false);
  setSelectedH5PContent(null);
  setAutoShowContent(null);
  
  // Remove from answered set for re-appearance
  if (contentToRewatch) {
    setAnsweredContent(prev => {
      const newSet = new Set(prev);
      newSet.delete(contentToRewatch.id);
      return newSet;
    });
  }
  
  // Enhanced video control with better error handling
  // ... video rewind and play logic
};
```

### Improved Auto-Popup Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (h5pContents.length > 0) {
    const activeContent = h5pContents.find(content => {
      const timestamp = content.timestamp || 0;
      const isAtTimestamp = Math.abs(currentTime - timestamp) < 0.5;
      const isNotAnswered = !answeredContent.has(content.id);
      return isAtTimestamp && isNotAnswered;
    });

    if (activeContent) {
      // Check if this content should auto-show
      const shouldShow = activeContent !== autoShowContent || !h5pDialogOpen;
      
      if (shouldShow) {
        // Auto-show the content
        setAutoShowContent(activeContent);
        setSelectedH5PContent(activeContent);
        setH5pDialogOpen(true);
        // Pause video when interaction appears
        if (videoRef.current && !videoRef.current.paused) {
          videoRef.current.pause();
          setIsPlaying(false);
        }
      }
    } else {
      // Clear auto-show content when no active content
      if (autoShowContent && !h5pDialogOpen) {
        setAutoShowContent(null);
      }
    }
  }
}, [currentTime, h5pContents, answeredContent, autoShowContent, h5pDialogOpen]);
```

### Enhanced Dialog Close Handlers
```typescript
// Dialog onClose handler
<Dialog 
  open={h5pDialogOpen} 
  onClose={() => {
    if (!showSuccessAnimation && !showIncorrectFeedback) {
      setH5pDialogOpen(false);
      setAutoShowContent(null);
      setSelectedH5PContent(null);
      // Resume video if it was paused
      if (videoRef.current && videoRef.current.paused) {
        videoRef.current.play();
        setIsPlaying(true);
      }
    }
  }}
>

// Close button handler
<Button onClick={() => {
  setH5pDialogOpen(false);
  setAutoShowContent(null);
  setSelectedH5PContent(null);
  // Resume video if it was paused
  if (videoRef.current && videoRef.current.paused) {
    videoRef.current.play();
    setIsPlaying(true);
  }
}}>
  Close
</Button>
```

## Technical Improvements

### State Management
1. **Proper State Clearing**: All relevant states are cleared in the correct order during rewatch
2. **Content Reference**: Store content reference before clearing states to avoid race conditions
3. **Dialog State Tracking**: Include `h5pDialogOpen` in dependency array for better reactivity

### Video Control
1. **Enhanced Async Handling**: Better handling of video seek and play operations
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Timeout fallback for seeked event listener
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error catching and logging for video operations

### Auto-Popup Logic
1. **Rewatch Compatibility**: Auto-popup now works properly after rewatch scenarios
2. **State Comparison**: Improved logic to determine when content should auto-show
3. **State Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when no active content is present

## User Experience Improvements

### Immediate Feedback
- Question dialog closes instantly when rewatch is clicked
- No delay or confusion about dialog state
- Clear visual feedback that rewatch action is happening

### Seamless Auto-Popup
- Questions automatically appear again after rewatch at correct timestamp
- No manual intervention required (no button clicking)
- Consistent behavior between first view and rewatch

### Video Control Integration
- Video pauses automatically when questions appear
- Video resumes when dialog is closed manually
- Proper play/pause state management throughout interactions

## Testing Scenarios

### Rewatch Functionality
1. Create H5P content with timestamp
2. Watch video until question appears
3. Answer incorrectly
4. Click "Rewatch (5s before)"
5. **Expected**: Dialog closes immediately, video rewinds and plays
6. **Expected**: Question auto-appears again at correct timestamp

### Auto-Popup After Rewatch
1. Follow rewatch scenario above
2. Let video play to question timestamp
3. **Expected**: Question auto-opens (not showing as button)
4. **Expected**: Video pauses when question appears

### Manual Dialog Close
1. Open question dialog
2. Click "Close" button or click outside dialog
3. **Expected**: Dialog closes and video resumes playing
4. **Expected**: States are properly cleared

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Seamless Experience**: No interruption in video viewing during rewatch
- **Consistent Behavior**: Questions always auto-appear at correct times
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions

### For Developers
- **Better State Management**: More predictable state transitions
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Improved logging for troubleshooting
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for video operations

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
   - Enhanced `handleRewatch` function
   - Improved auto-popup useEffect
   - Updated dialog close handlers

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All rewatch and auto-popup issues resolved
- Question dialog closes immediately on rewatch
- Video playback works seamlessly during rewatch
- Questions auto-appear correctly after rewatch (no button overlay)
- Proper state management throughout all interactions
